## Configuration

For configuration check [documentation](https://docs.karmen.tech/#/karmen-octo-plugin).

## Secure communication

Security is a key concern to us. Rest assured, your device public address will not be exposed when using this plugin. Rather, communication between Karmen and your Octoprint installation is made using a secure WebSocket channel protected by HTTPS protocol which is used by major organizations like eshops, banks and others.

Karmen also uses key exchange to ensure it speaks to the expected device on the other end. Key set is established during the initial setup.

## Privacy policy

We guarantee that information about you or about your printers will never be sold or even shared to any third party.
